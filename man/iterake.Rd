\usage{
iterake(
  universe,
  wgt.name = "weight",

  threshold = 1e-10,
  max.iter = 50,

}
\arguments{
\item{universe}{Output object created with \code{universe()} function.}

\item{wgt.name}{Name given to column of weights to be added to data, default is "weight", optional.}

\item{max.wgt}{Maximum value weights can take on, default is 3, optional. The capping 
takes place prior to applying expansion factor (if \code{N} is set in \code{universe()}.}

\item{threshold}{Value specifying minimum summed difference between weighted marginal 
proportions of sample and universe before algorithm quits, default is 1e-10, optional.}

\item{max.iter}{Value capping number of iterations for the procedure, default is 50, optional.}

\item{stuck.limit}{Value capping the number of times summed differences between sample 
and universe can oscillate between increasing and decreasing, default is 5, optional.}

\item{permute}{Boolean indicating whether to test all possible orders of categories in \code{universe} 
and keep the most efficient (\code{TRUE}) or to test categories in the order listed in \code{universe} 
only (default, \code{FALSE}), optional. Note that when \code{TRUE} this will increase runtime by a 
factor of \code{(number of categories)!}.}

\item{summary}{Whether or not to display summary output of the procedure, default is \code{TRUE}, optional.}
}
\value{
Data frame with the resulting weight variable appended to it.
}
\description{
This function creates row-level weights using an iterative raking algorithm based
on targets from a known population (established with \code{universe()}).
The weights are appended as a new column in the data. If \code{iterake()} 
converges, the weighted marginal proportions of the sample will match those
set in \code{universe()}. Summary statistics of the weighting procedure are 
presented by default.
